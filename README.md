# Parlens PWA

Parlens is a decentralized parking utility app built on the Nostr protocol. It allows users to track their parking history, find parking areas reported by other users, list valid parking spots, and plan routes, all without a centralized server holding your data.

## Features

- **Vehicle Types**: Support for Cars, Motorcycles, and Bicycles with custom rates.
- **Parking History**: Log where you parked providing a personal history of your spots.
- **Parking Area Reports**: Share parking availability updates with the community anonymously.
- **Listed Parking**: View and manage formal parking listings with specific spots and rates.
- **No Parking Reporting**: Flag areas where parking is prohibited to warn others.
- **Privacy-First Routing**: Plan routes and save them encrypted to your profile.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All personal data (logs, routes) is encrypted using NIP-44.
- **PWA Ready**: Installable on iOS and Android for a native app experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Maps**: MapLibre GL & Leaflet (via React Leaflet)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
- **Protocol**: Nostr (via nostr-tools and @nostrify/react)
- **State Management**: React Context & TanStack Query
